"""
Example demonstrating LangGraph workflow integration with Contexa SDK.

This example shows how to:
1. Create a Contexa AgentTeam with multiple specialized agents
2. Convert the team to a LangGraph workflow
3. Execute the workflow to accomplish a multi-step task

This integration allows you to use Contexa's agent definitions with LangGraph's
powerful workflow orchestration capabilities.
