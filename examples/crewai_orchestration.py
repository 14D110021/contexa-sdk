"""Example demonstrating CrewAI orchestration integration with Contexa SDK.

This example shows how to:
1. Create a Contexa AgentTeam with multiple specialized agents and defined handoffs
2. Convert the team to a CrewAI Crew for execution
3. Execute the Crew to accomplish a multi-step task

This integration allows leveraging CrewAI's native workflow capabilities with
Contexa's standardized agent definitions.
