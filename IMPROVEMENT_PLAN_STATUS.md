# Google Adapter Improvements - Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of implementing improvements to the Google adapters in the Contexa SDK.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Separated Google GenAI and Google ADK adapters into proper directories
- [x] Created clear imports for both adapter types with prefixes (genai_* and adk_*)
- [x] Implemented robust error handling in both adapters
- [x] Updated test suite to pass with both adapter implementations
- [x] Made GenAI adapter handle both ContexaTool instances and decorated functions
- [x] Added synchronous wrappers for async functions for better usability
- [x] Ensured backward compatibility with existing code using non-prefixed exports
- [x] Enhanced mock implementations for testing without SDK dependencies

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Update installation documentation with separate adapter options
- [ ] Create comprehensive examples for both GenAI and ADK adapters
- [ ] Add detailed API documentation for both adapters
- [ ] Update integration tests to validate cross-framework compatibility with both adapters

## Planned Tasks

- [ ] Improve setup.py to clearly distinguish between adapter dependencies
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing specific to each Google adapter's unique features
- [ ] Document testing approach for adapters when actual dependencies aren't available
- [ ] Create detailed guides for choosing between GenAI SDK and ADK

## Next Steps

1. Complete the documentation updates that reflect the new adapter organization
2. Update the setup.py file with clear optional dependencies for each adapter
3. Create examples that demonstrate the differences between GenAI and ADK adapters
4. Update the main README to reflect the new adapter structure and naming conventions

## Issues & Challenges

- Testing without actual dependencies requires careful mocking (addressed with improved mocks)
- Ensuring backward compatibility with existing code (addressed with non-prefixed exports)
- Making adapters that work with both decorated functions and direct tool instances (addressed)
- Maintaining consistent behavior between the two adapter types where appropriate

## Overall Progress

- **Documentation**: 40% complete
- **Implementation**: 95% complete
- **Testing**: 80% complete
- **Examples**: 50% complete
