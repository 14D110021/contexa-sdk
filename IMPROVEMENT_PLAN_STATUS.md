These improvements will make the SDK more accessible to new users and provide better reference materials for experienced developers working with the Contexa platform.

## Issues & Challenges

- Testing without actual dependencies requires careful mocking (addressed with improved mocks)
- Ensuring backward compatibility with existing code (addressed with non-prefixed exports)
- Making adapters that work with both decorated functions and direct tool instances (addressed)
- Maintaining consistent behavior between the two adapter types where appropriate

## Overall Progress

- **Implementation**: 100% complete
- **Testing**: 100% complete
- **Examples**: 100% complete
- **Overall**: 100% complete
