# Google Adapter Improvements - Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of implementing improvements to the Google adapters in the Contexa SDK.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Separated Google GenAI and Google ADK adapters into proper directories
- [x] Created clear imports for both adapter types with prefixes (genai_* and adk_*)
- [x] Implemented robust error handling in both adapters
- [x] Updated test suite to pass with both adapter implementations
- [x] Made GenAI adapter handle both ContexaTool instances and decorated functions
- [x] Added synchronous wrappers for async functions for better usability
- [x] Ensured backward compatibility with existing code using non-prefixed exports
- [x] Enhanced mock implementations for testing without SDK dependencies
- [x] Updated CHANGELOG.md with Google adapter changes
- [x] Created version compatibility matrix in FRAMEWORK_COMPATIBILITY.md
- [x] Created developer guidelines in DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md
- [x] Updated README.md with clearer guidance on adapter selection
- [x] Updated setup.py with separate dependencies for each adapter type
- [x] Removed old adapter files (google_adk.py and google_genai.py)

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Update installation documentation with separate adapter options
- [ ] Add detailed API documentation for both adapters (docstrings)
- [ ] Create comprehensive comparative examples showing when to use which adapter
- [ ] Update integration tests to validate cross-framework compatibility with both adapters

## Planned Tasks

- [ ] Add comprehensive testing specific to each Google adapter's unique features
- [ ] Document testing approach for adapters when actual dependencies aren't available
- [ ] Create migration guide for users moving from old structure to new adapter architecture
- [ ] Prepare for official release with finalized version numbers

## Next Steps

1. Complete docstrings for all public functions in the Google adapter modules
2. Create a comparative example demonstrating when to use GenAI vs ADK
3. Finalize integration tests for cross-framework compatibility
4. Create a migration guide for existing users

## Issues & Challenges

- Testing without actual dependencies requires careful mocking (addressed with improved mocks)
- Ensuring backward compatibility with existing code (addressed with non-prefixed exports)
- Making adapters that work with both decorated functions and direct tool instances (addressed)
- Maintaining consistent behavior between the two adapter types where appropriate

## Overall Progress
